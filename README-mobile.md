You can insert line breaks without needing spaces.

## Usage

Say we have the following Markdown (note: thereâ€™s no spaces after `a`):

```
This is a
paragraph.
```

With this plugin, it yields:

```
<p>This is a<br>
paragraph.</p>
```

Without `breaks` plugin, you'd get:

```
<p>This is a
paragraph.</p>
```
